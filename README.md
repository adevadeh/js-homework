# js-homework


## Assignments
The assignments can be found in the `default` branch. They should each take 30-90min, and are meant to go along with a background in pre-algebra and brief discussion of the Newtonian model of Gravity. 

You need a text editor and access to git. The code can be edited in any text editor, and can be run using NodeJS on the command line. For example:
    
    $ node assignment1.js

You can also run your JS code in a browser using a tool such as CodePen or JSBin. Note that the output will appear in the console section of the browser.

## Topics Covered
* Functions, paramaters, mathematical operations
* Calling functions, building on top of your functions
* Basic loops and conditionals

## Getting the code and submitting your work
Use git clone to copy the code to your computer. Edit and run the code on your own computer, committing your solutions to your own branch. Then you can submit your solutions in your own branch. If you want to get new assignments, merge default into your branch.

    $ git clone git@github.com:adevadeh/js-homework.git
    $ cd js-homework
    $ git checkout <my-github-username>
    $ git commit <commit my solutions>
    $ git push origin <my-github-username>

## Contributions
If you wish to edit the lessons, clarify questions, improve the framing, or fix typos, please submit a pull request on the `default` branch. Make sure to base your changes off of the `default` branch as well, we don't want any solutions in there.
