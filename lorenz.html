## The Lorenz Equations

As an example of a system of three simultaneous equations, consider the Lorenz system.
This system has a number of important applications including weather forecasting. 
The system has the form:

	dx/dt = sigma(y − x)
	dy/dt = rho*x − y − xz
	dz/dt = xy − beta*z

The values x, y, and z reference values in a 3D space. The value t is time.
The symbol d refers to the difference of a value. For example, the difference
of x over difference in time.

As the parameters sigma, rho, and beta will vary through various ranges of values, and the
solutions of this system of differential equations vary in form. In particular, for
certain values of the parameters the system exhibits chaotic behavior.

For rho = 126.52 and for other large values of rho the behavior of this system is chaotic.
In fact for rho > 24.7 most orbits exhibit chaotic wandering. The trajectory passes around
two points of attraction, called strange attractors, switching from one to another in an
apparently unpredictable fashion. This appearance of apparently random behavior is remarkable
considering the clearly deterministic nature of the problem. However, for other values of rho the
behavior of the trajectories is simple and stable.

Write a function to return the Lorenz equation values as changing over time using the base
values: sigma = 10, beta = 8/3, and rho = 28. -->
